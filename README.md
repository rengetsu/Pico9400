# Pico9400
Pico9400 oscilloscope software.

This is a program designed to work with oscilloscopes. 

At the moment, it is under development, while only the graphical interface is being created! 

## Important note
This is a project that contains only that part of the code that is responsible for managing the graphical user interface!
All the code responsible for working with the hardware program is removed here.
